# Shop Sense

**Duration:** March 2024 - May 2024  
**Affiliation:** Rajalakshmi Institute of Technology

## Project Overview

Shop Sense is an innovative RFID-based navigation system designed to enhance the shopping experience for visually impaired individuals. By integrating RFID tags with tactile paving, the system guides users through stores and provides essential product details via an audio interface. This design ensures a fast, accurate, and independent shopping experience for over 352,000 visually impaired individuals in Tamil Nadu, 4.9 million in India, and 40 million globally.

## Key Features

- **RFID Integration:** Utilizes RFID tags placed alongside tactile paving to identify specific product categories, such as dairy products.
- **Tactile Guidance:** Employs tactile paving with two distinct designs to guide users through the store.
- **Audio Feedback:** Provides product information and quantities through an audio interface, ensuring users receive real-time updates.
- **User-Friendly Design:** Ensures a seamless and dignified shopping experience, promoting autonomy for visually impaired shoppers.

## System Components

- **Microcontroller:** Equipped with Wi-Fi and Bluetooth capabilities to manage system operations.
- **RFID Module & Tags:** Detects and identifies product categories.
- **Speaker & 3.5mm Jack:** Delivers audio feedback to users.
- **Tactile Paving:** Features two distinct designs to guide users and indicate product categories.

## How It Works

1. **Navigation:** Users follow the tactile paving paths within the store.
2. **Product Detection:** As users approach specific product categories, the RFID module detects the corresponding RFID tags.
3. **Audio Feedback:** The system provides audio information about the product category and available quantities through the speaker or connected headphones.

## Benefits

- **Empowerment:** Promotes independence for visually impaired individuals by facilitating autonomous shopping.
- **Inclusivity:** Aligns with global goals to create inclusive shopping environments.
- **Efficiency:** Offers a fast and accurate method for product identification and navigation within stores.

## Skills Utilized

- Radio-Frequency Identification (RFID)
- ESP32 Microcontrollers
